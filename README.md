# 🩺 Stroke Prediction Analysis Dashboard

This project provides an interactive **Power BI Dashboard** focused on **Stroke Prediction Analysis**. The goal is to provide healthcare professionals and analysts with insights into stroke risk factors using visual analytics, helping in early diagnosis and preventive strategies.

## 📂 Project Overview

Stroke is a serious medical condition that can lead to long-term disability or death. This dashboard leverages data analytics and visualization to identify important trends, patterns, and key risk factors associated with strokes.

The project involves:

* Cleaning and transforming healthcare data.
* Visualizing key relationships among features influencing stroke risk.
* Providing actionable insights for healthcare analysis and decision-making.
